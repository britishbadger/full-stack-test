# Full Stack - Technical Assesment
Our tech teams are curious, driven, intelligent, pragmatic, collaborative and open-minded and you should be too.

## Testing Goals
We are testing your ability to rapidly prototype (MVP) an application underpinned by good software engineering practises that demonstrate a broad range of skills within a full stack (front end, mid-tier and backend).

## The Task
You are required to build a prototype healthcare application that presents a summary of the patients care record to a clinician in a healthcare setting using the data provided.

You will have approximately 1 week to complete this task and should focus on an MVP but you are free to take this as far as you wish.

## The Solution
Your MVP can use any of the following technologies along with **any frameworks, libraries you feel appropriate**:

- **Frontend** - Typecript/Javascript, React / Angular (Preferaably React)
- **Middleware Programming Languages** - Java / Python / JavaScript / Typescript
- **DBs** - MongoDB / MySql / Postgres / SQLServer Express / Filesystem

You should containerise your application using docker / docker-compose. 

## Context
[FHIR](/https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html) is a popular standard within healthcare used by healthcare systems to exchange data and represent details of paitents in a standardised way. Some sample FHIR data has been generated in the data directory using a tool called [synthea](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html). 

As FHIR is a standard there may be many libraries and UI widgets you can use freely. Google is your friend.

## Submit your solution	
Create a public Github repository and push your solution including any documentation you feel necessary. Commit often - we would rather see a history of trial and error than a single monolithic push. When you're finished, please send us the URL to the repository.
